# Final_Project
## Topic
> <b> To be update <b>
### The reason why we selected this topic
> <b> To be update <b>
### Description of the source data
> <b> To be update <b>
### Questions we hope to answer
* What is the correlation between happiness and income?
* How employement status effect on happiness ?
* Can overall poverty in indivual country lower the expectation ? 
* Can we create a heat map regarding to our results to see if there is a relation between geolocation and income-happiness data results ?

## Roles
### Square
Nehir
- Responsible for the repository
- Make sure everyone has a branch on their own
- Watching all the process was made in branches, keep the updates.
- Testing, discussing before merging into a main branch.
### Triangle

- Nusrat

    - Contribute to data cleaning and preprocessing
    - 
    -
    
### Circle
Amanda
### X Role 
Kartikye
- discuss how data will be cleaned then merged, may need to create additonal tables in database to export
- assist <b>Amanda</b> in laying down framework for SQL files
-If group pace is faster then project timeline begin research into establishing "github pages" to create website visual
    - look to previous modules for guidance/look to TA's for insight
- assist <b>Nusrat</b> with machine learning model or creating correlation chart/matrix

### Visualization

## Technology

### Data Preprocessing

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

### Database Storage

- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin4

### Machine Learning

SciKitLearn - machine learning library to fit the model.

### Dashboard

- Tableau - to create a dashboard displaying the results of our analysis.
- GitHub - ReadMe and files for project

## Segment I: Sketch It Out!

- First segment list of deliverables:

    - Finalize dataset for the project
    - Making a flowchart
    - Identification of technology
    - Creating database
    - Mockup of machine learning
 
### Exploratory Data Analysis (ERD)

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

#### Database Storage Set up
    
### Machine Learning mockup
    
##### Description of the preliminary data preprocessing

##### Description of preliminary feature selection

##### Explanation of model choice

=======
- Discuss ideas for possible visuals for the final project
- Look over data to see what visual applications may fit
## Methods 
> Unsupervised ML 
## Why and How ?

## Data Cleaning
> Drop extra columns , drop empty rows, check duplicates, making all the datasets country Indexes the same to make the joins without losing the data
