1) I use a different format style for happiness_complete.json

2) Only alter the plots.js inisde static/js folder, leave main one alone for reference on how to path code

3)If struggling to fit data in html got to index.html
	-  switch class = "container" to class = "container-fluid"
	- in doing so the website will adapt to users screen resolution
